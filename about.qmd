::: {#hero-heading}

I'm currently a PhD candidate at [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/), where my research focuses on **project management** and its connection to **project success**, with a particular interest in understanding the impact of end-user bricolage initiatives on **project success**.

In addition to my research, I've been sharing my knowledge by lecturing on project management at [Nova SBE](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/) since 2012.

Beyond academia, I have a strong interest in **R** and **R development**, specializing in creating leadership skills assessment tools and personalized reports. I also contribute as a moderator for [SocArXiv](https://socopen.org/).

My **interests** include:

* Project management and project success
* Fuzzy-set analysis
* Survey-based quantitative empirical research
* Reproducible automatic data analysis and reporting with R

Outside of work, my time is mostly occupied by my three wonderful children, who keep me on my toes and bring joy to my life. I love spending time outdoors, and during the summer you can often find me at the beach, enjoying the sun, sea, and a good book. I am fluent in English, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish, and I've been trying to learn Hebrew for the past few years, although progress has been slow.
